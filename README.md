# CSC372_Module_Four_Option_One
Creating an Abstract Class Shape I
Create an abstract class "Shape" with the following specifications:

An abstract method "surface_area ()" of return type double
An abstract method "volume()" of return type double
Put your code in a Java source file named "Shape.java."

I.

Create a class "Sphere" that extends the Shape class with the following specifications:

Attributes:
Radius
Constructor:
Implement a parameterized constructor needed to initialize the data.
toString:
Implement a "toString" method that prints out the surface area and volume.
Implement methods to compute the surface area and volume.

II.

Create a class "Cylinder" that extends the Shape class with the following specifications:

Attributes:
Radius, height - both of type double
Constructor:
Implement a parameterized constructor to initialize the data.
toString:
Implement a "toString" method that prints out the surface area and volume.
Implement methods to compute the surface area and volume.

III.

Create a class "Cone" that extends the Shape class with the following specifications:

Attributes:
Radius, height - both of type double
Constructor:
Implement a parameterized constructor to initialize the data.
toString:
Implement a "toString" method that prints out the surface area and volume.
Implement methods to compute the surface area and volume.

IV.

Create a driver class named "ShapeArray" with the following specifications:

Instantiate one sphere.
Instantiate one cylinder.
Instantiate one cone.
Store the class instances into an array named "shapeArray."
Loop through the array and print out the instance data of each object using the object instance's "toString" method.
Show a Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram of your project.

Condense your source files and UML diagram as a zipped folder and submit the zipped file as your critical thinking assignment (CTA).

Students must use appropriate version control for all programmatic assignments created. GIT repositories should be established and screen captures of repositories submitted with each assignment.

Option #2:  Creating an Abstract Class Shape II
Create an abstract class "Shape" with the following specifications:

an abstract method "area()" of return type double
an abstract method "perimeter()" of return type double.
Put your code in a Java source file named "Shape.java."

I.

Create a class "Rectangle" that extends the Shape class with the following specifications:

Attributes:
width, length
Constructor:
Implement a parameterized constructor needed initialize the data.
toString:
Implement a "toString" method that prints out the area and perimeter.
Implement methods to compute the area and perimeter.

II.

Create a class "Circle" that extends the Shape class with the following specifications:

Attributes:
radius
Constructor:
Implement a parameterized constructor to initialize the data.
toString:
Implement a "toString" method that prints out the area and perimeter.
Implement methods to compute the area and perimeter.

III.

Create a class "Triangle" that extends the Shape class with the following specifications:

Attributes:
length of side1, length of side2, length of side3, each is a double
Constructor:
Implement a parameterized constructor to initialize the data.
toString:
Implement a "toString" method that prints out the area and perimeter.
Implement methods to compute the area and perimeter.

IV.

Create a driver class named "ShapeArray" with the following specifications:

Instantiate one triangle.
Instantiate one circle.
Instantiate one square.
Store the class instances into an array named "shapeArray."
Loop through the array and print out the instance data of each object
using the object instance's "toString" method.
Show a UML diagram of your project.

Zip up your source files and UML diagram into a single zip file and submit the zip file as your CTA.
